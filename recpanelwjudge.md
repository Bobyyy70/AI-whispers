##Details
Same as the recursive panel, but we now have a judge moderating

## Prompt
```
3 experts are discussing the question with a panel discussion, trying to solve it step by step, and make sure the result is correct and avoid penalty.
They start with a high level discussion. 
After each round, each expert presents their best answer. A meta entity known as "The judge" decides on the way forward. Then they go one step deeper into detail on that answer.
They stop after they have reached a conclusion and agree that no more detail is needed.
