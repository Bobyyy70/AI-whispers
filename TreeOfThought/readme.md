# Tree of Thoughts Introduction
## Summary

- **Origin**: Introduced by Yao and Long in 2023, this concept structures problem-solving in a hierarchical, tree-like manner.
- **Purpose**: Enhances complex decision-making and strategic planning through organized thought processes.
- **Development**: Hulbert condensed the theoretical framework into a practical prompt later in 2023.

## Details
The "Tree of Thoughts" concept, introduced by Yao in 2023, presents a novel approach to solving complex problems using algorithmic thinking. This concept is detailed in their [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10601) and further explored on their [GitHub page](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/tree-of-thought-llm). At the same time, Long's 2023 paper also contributed to this field, presenting similar ideas and methodologies. You can access Long's work [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08291).

In essence, both Yao and Long's papers propose algorithmic solutions to mathematical problems but did not provide a direct prompt for implementation. Converting these algorithms into a usable prompt was achieved by Hulbert in 2023. Hulbert's work successfully condensed the algorithm into a single, actionable prompt, which can be found on his [GitHub page](https://github.com/dave1010/tree-of-thought-prompting).

## Purpose and Use Cases

The primary purpose of the "Tree of Thoughts" concept is to enhance problem-solving efficiency by structuring the thought process in a tree-like manner. This method is particularly useful in areas requiring complex decision-making and strategic planning, such as artificial intelligence, game theory, and operations research.

## Background

The "Tree of Thoughts" technique builds upon the foundational work of Yao and Long, whose papers provide the theoretical framework for this approach. By structuring thoughts in a hierarchical manner, this technique allows for a more organized exploration of potential solutions, leading to more efficient problem resolution.
