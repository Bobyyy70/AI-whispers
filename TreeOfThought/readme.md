# Tree of Thoughts
The initial "Tree of Thoughts" concept was introduced by Yao in 2023, and you can explore their work [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10601), and on their [GitHub page](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/tree-of-thought-llm).

Long's 2023 paper was basically the same, at the same time.
Their paper is available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08291).

Personally, I would give the creator title for this technique to both.

Both papers are algorithmic solutions to math problems and produced no direct prompt.

This was done by Hulbert in 2023, who successfully condensed the algorithm into a single prompt.
You can view this on the [GitHub page](https://github.com/dave1010/tree-of-thought-prompting).
