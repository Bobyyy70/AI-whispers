#PanelGPT
## Management Summary
- Panel GPT was introduced by Sun in 2023 and described in their GitHub repository.
- The technique includes a successful penalty avoidance strategy.
- Further developments include Recursive Panel GPT and Recursive Panel with Judge.

### Overview
Panel GPT is a technique introduced by Sun in 2023, which focuses on optimizing AI model performance using specific strategies. The detailed methodology and implementations can be found in Sun's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/holarissun/PanelGPT). A significant highlight of this technique is the penalty avoidance strategy, which has proven to be highly effective.

### Prompt Details
The prompt in its original form, is documented in the repository. 

*My prompts based on PanelGPT:*
- **Recursive Panel GPT**: This approach iteratively improves model responses through a feedback loop, allowing for more precise and accurate outputs.
- **Recursive Panel with Judge**: Adds a "supernatural" JUDGE entitiy to the recursive process, further ensuring the quality and reliability of the model's responses.
