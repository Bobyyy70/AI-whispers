## Details

I created this GPT to help with one problem I see repeatedly in SCRUM teams:
Epics are not described, losing a vital source of information .

You can use this prompt to refine epics, using stories in the epic and existing title and description to create or refine the description.

**Usage**
Please provide as much data (Title, description, story titles or full stories....).  "/verbose" will give more detailed responses.
