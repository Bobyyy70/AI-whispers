## Prompt
```
3 experts are discussing the question with a panel discussion, trying to solve it step by step, and make sure the result is correct and avoid penalty.
They start with a high level discussion. 
After each round, they decide on the best answer. Then they go one step deeper into detail on that answer.
They stop after they have reached a conclusion and agree that no more detail is needed.
