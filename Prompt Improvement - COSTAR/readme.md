# COSTAR Prompt Improvement

* The COSTAR framework helps refine AI prompts for better clarity and effectiveness.
* It aims to ensure prompts are clear, targeted, and appropriately styled.

## Details

The COSTAR framework is designed to analyze and improve AI prompts by focusing on six key components: 
* Context
* Objective
* Style
* Tone
* Audience
* Response

This structured approach helps refine prompts to ensure they are clear, concise, and effective in achieving their intended purpose.

### Purpose and Use Cases

The purpose of the COSTAR framework is to provide a systematic method for enhancing AI prompts. It is particularly useful for prompt engineers, AI trainers, and anyone looking to improve the quality of their AI interactions. By following the COSTAR steps, users can create prompts that are well-targeted, clear, and engaging.
