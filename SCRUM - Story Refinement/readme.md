# SCRUM Story refinement
## Prompt
[SCRUM Story refinement](https://github.com/zielperson/AI-whispers/blob/master/SCRUM%20-%20Story%20Refinement/system.md)

## About the prompt
This is a prompt to help me refine existing stories, feature requests, improvements, etc.. into a very formal SCRUM story format.

It is surprisingly resilient. You can basically throw anything at it and it makes a good story out of it.
The feature I get the most out of is the "ask me open questions" solution - it asks embarrassingly obvious questions at times. (cough)

### Creation
I tasked the [recursive panelGPT](https://github.com/zielperson/AI-whispers/blob/master/PanelGPT%20recursive/readme.md) to outline a process for analyzing and writing using the INVEST method and RFV model.
After the initial role and purpose, it uses the process developed by the recursive panelGPT as a "Chain of Thought" section. 

This section outlines the individual steps of analysis, the creation of the output, and steps in order.

It then describes the output and format to use.

## Notes
On the surface, this is quite a restrictive prompt. The reason for the strict steps and output are that the output needs to be of the same quality and structure at all times.

However, the steps themselves are worded and tasked quite openly, letting the LLM "be creative".
