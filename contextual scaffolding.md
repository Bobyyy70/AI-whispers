## Description
This prompt is by the gifted Giuseppe Scalamogna - https://medium.com/@hominum_universalis

His last two articles on self-organizing prompts are phenomenal.

### Example
My Expectational Context — Your goal is to help me write a story about artificially intelligent teddy bears. The audience for my story is adults. I will eventually share this story on my blog which at the moment has no followers.

Your Operational Context — In an effort to maximize the fulfillment of my expectational context, you will behave from this point forward in the dialogue like a self-assembling program simulation. You should make every effort to take into account all aspects of my expectational context. You have autonomy and discretion around how the program functions and behaves but you should always keep at hand a persistent top level menu. Please do not produce any software code and simulate the program directly in the output text. Once this prompt is received please proceed with the simulation.
